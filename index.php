                            This test will test your general knowledge on school subjects.
                            Including programming, mathematics, physics, english, chemistry, technology,
                            history, politics, biology, geograghy and religion. <br><br>
                            
                            The test has 22 questions and you will be given 60 seconds to answer each one.
                            You will have a score aswell which is determined by the time you answer. 
                            The shorter time it takes for you to answer the more points you will get. 
                            If you do not answer correctly you will get 0 points.<br><br>

                            The difficulty level of this test is pre-high school. 
                            You will be required to have a beginner level understanding of the programming language Python. 
                            Despite the school education system having just recently introduced programming in school.<br><br>

                            The score points does not get saved. If you are gonna cheat you are just going to be
                            dishonest against yourself.
